1.1 Business Problem Definition:
The objective of this project is to analyze the current job market trends and identify the most in-demand jobs, skills, and responsibilities based on 1.3 million LinkedIn job postings scraped in the year 2024. By leveraging this dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights to job seekers, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their job search strategies and upskilling efforts. Specifically, we will focus on uncovering the top jobs, skills, and job responsibilities across various locations, industries, companies, and their organizational positions.

1.2 Introduction & Motivation:
As active job seekers ourselves, especially as MSBA students facing a highly competitive job market, we recognize the critical importance of staying well-informed about the ever-evolving demands and trends shaping the current job market. It is imperative for us to take proactive actions to navigate this dynamic environment effectively. With a focus on empowering job seekers like MSBA students, we have embarked on an extensive investigation that delves deep into a comprehensive dataset of 1.3 million LinkedIn job listings and associated skills. Our analysis presents a multi-faceted understanding of the dynamic job market, spanning across various crucial elements.

Our analysis concentrates on three main aspects: skills, industries, and salaries. Firstly, we identify in-demand jobs and skillsets that are highly sought after by employers, providing job seekers with valuable guidance on tailoring their resumes, cover letters, and interview preparations to align with these specific needs. Secondly, we highlight the qualifications and competencies that are highly valued in the current job market, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about pursuing additional education, certifications, or training programs to enhance their employability and career prospects. This approach fosters a mindset of continuous professional development and lifelong learning.

Regarding industries, we analyze the sectors that are actively hiring for data-related roles, offering insights into the high-demand fields within this domain. Additionally, we examine the top skills required by each specific industry, allowing job seekers to tailor their skill development efforts to align with the unique needs of their desired industries. Lastly, our salary analysis unveils the variations in pay across different industries for identical job categories, as well as the nuances in salaries within data-related roles based on factors such as programming languages and required tasks. This analysis empowers job seekers to make financially informed career choices.

Our multi-faceted approach equips job seekers with comprehensive, data-driven insights, enabling strategic career planning and decision-making. By leveraging these insights, individuals can position themselves more effectively in the competitive job market, enhancing their chances of securing desirable opportunities that align with their goals and career paths.

1.3 Executive Summary:
Through our analysis, we used the power of PySpark and Big Data analytics to extract and condense insights on job skills, tools, responsibilities, industries, salaries, and more from over a million LinkedIn job postings. In the first half of our analysis, we provided a broad overview of the current state of the job market. In the latter part of our analysis, we dug deeper into data-related roles and uncovered the skills and tools required for each of the three main roles within this field: analyst, scientist, and engineer. We also explained how the role of a data professional varies by industry and provided data-driven recommendations on what tools to learn to stand out in the industry of your choosing. We also looked at the salary expectations across roles and industries, highlighting the upward mobility that top tools and skills provide. In summary, we provide a data-driven search strategy to help you land the perfect role!
